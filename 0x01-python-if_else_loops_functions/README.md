### 1- Python: Data type
    What makes data types different in Python??
        In Python 🐍,
        think 🤔 of data types like containers for different
        kinds of information.
        They help your program know how to treat and handle numbers,
        decimals, or text. For instance, integers are for whole numbers,
        floats deal with decimals, and strings handle text.
        Choosing the right container ensures your code runs smoothly 
        and does what you want it to do!
